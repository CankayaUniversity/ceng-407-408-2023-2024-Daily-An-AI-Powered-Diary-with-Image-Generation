0,"Today felt like a never-ending spiral into darkness. From the moment I woke up, a heavy weight settled over me, suffocating any hint of joy or hope. The world seemed to mirror the turmoil within me, with grey skies and cold rain casting a bleak shadow over everything. As I went about my day, each task felt like an insurmountable hurdle. Simple chores became overwhelming, and even the smallest setbacks felt like crushing defeats. It was as if I was trapped in a never-ending cycle of frustration and despair, with no escape in sight. The weight of loneliness bore down on me, crushing my spirit with its suffocating grip. Despite being surrounded by people, I felt utterly alone, as if I was adrift in a vast ocean of emptiness. No words of comfort could penetrate the walls I had built around myself, leaving me to drown in my own sorrow. As the day drew to a close, a sense of exhaustion washed over me, both physical and emotional. I longed for the solace of sleep, hoping that tomorrow would bring a glimmer of light to pierce the darkness that had consumed me. But for now, I am left to wrestle with my demons in the silence of the night, hoping against hope for a better tomorrow."

You will never be just mine, and I cannot change that. No matter how many times i whisper my prayers into the emptiness of my room, you’ll never be mine. I thought you meant every word that crossed the break of your lips. Now i know that the sweetness was all a perfectly planned disguise. So why didn’t you enlighten me sooner? Why am I still here waiting for you? You crushed my soul and spirit. I now fully understand how the truth of pure anguish fills. I accepted that you were my forever. I presumed that you were my home. What hurts the most is that I maintain that I can never hate you. I will always love you. I will spend my whole life awaiting the day I won’t yearn for you anymore. However that will always be slightly out of reach. Perhaps I can finally stop longing for you when my bones are in a grand oak box, the earth surrounding me fully. I fear that even in death I will crave eternally for the love I never received from you. My broken body will decompose into exquisite flowers, but even then, they will reach high towards the warmth of the sun instead of your arms."
2,"Today was like a radiant sunrise, painting the sky with hues of warmth and possibility. I woke up with a lightness in my heart, as if the universe whispered secrets of happiness into my soul. The morning breeze carried whispers of laughter and promises of new beginnings, filling me with an overwhelming sense of contentment. As I stepped outside, nature greeted me with open arms, inviting me to dance to the rhythm of life. The birds sang melodies of hope, their cheerful tunes echoing through the air, lifting my spirits higher with each note. The gentle caress of sunlight kissed my skin, infusing me with a gentle glow of serenity. Throughout the day, I found myself surrounded by the beauty of small moments and simple pleasures. From the laughter of children playing in the park to the comforting embrace of a loved one, each interaction was like a precious gem, sparkling with the light of happiness. Evening descended like a soft blanket of stars, wrapping me in a cocoon of peace and gratitude. As I reflect on the day's blessings, I'm reminded that true joy lies not in grand gestures or material possessions, but in the beauty of connection and the gift of being present in each moment."
